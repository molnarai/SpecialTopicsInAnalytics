Assignments in this course are **individual tasks** designed to enhance student learning and
provide opportunities for independent practice. Detailed instructions for completing each assignment,
along with submission guidelines, will be made available on the class website.

It is essential for students to adhere strictly to these submission instructions, as assignments that fail to comply or are submitted
past the deadline will not be considered for grading.

This policy ensures fairness and consistency in the
evaluation process while emphasizing the importance of personal responsibility in meeting academic
expectations.

<!-- **The instructions and grading criteria are subject to change. Please check this site for updates and follow announcement in class and on [iCollege](https://icollege.gsu.edu)** -->
