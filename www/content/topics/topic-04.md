This session covers Apache Spark, its architecture, and various components, providing a comprehensive overview of the unified analytics engine.
<!-- more -->

We discuss how Apache Spark offers in-memory processing and supports a wide range of data sources, enabling it to handle large-scale datasets by distributing computations across multiple nodes in the cluster. We also explore its key features, including high-level APIs, streaming capabilities, and advanced data processing techniques.

We compare Spark to Pandas, highlighting their respective strengths and use cases. We show how Spark is particularly suited for big data analytics and distributed computing, whereas Pandas excels at in-memory computing with smaller datasets. The choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific requirements of a project.

In this session, we introduce Spark DataFrames, covering various aspects such as schema, loading data, and inspecting DataFrames. We demonstrate how to create a DataFrame from different sources like CSV files, JSON, or databases, and explain how to manipulate DataFrames using methods provided by the API.

We also cover advanced operations on DataFrames, including column and row manipulations, filtering and conditional logic, aggregations, joins, window functions, handling missing data, and integrating with SQL queries. Throughout this session, we provide various techniques for optimizing performance and ensuring efficient computation.

**2. Spark vs Pandas: Why and When to Use Spark**

1. What is Pandas, and what is it commonly used for?
1. What are the key differences between Spark and Pandas in terms of data storage and processing?
1. Describe scenarios where Spark would be a better choice than Pandas. Consider data size and processing requirements.
1. Describe scenarios where Pandas would be a better choice than Spark.

**3. Introduction to Spark DataFrames: Schema, Loading Data, Inspecting DataFrames**
1. What is a DataFrame schema? Why is defining a schema important when working with DataFrames?
1. Describe the common methods for loading data into a Spark DataFrame (e.g., from CSV, JSON, Parquet).
1. What are some common methods for inspecting a DataFrame (e.g., show(), printSchema(), count())? What information does each provide?
1. You have a CSV file with inconsistent data types in some columns. How would you handle this when loading it into a Spark DataFrame? Explain your approach.

**4. Distributed Computing Basics in Spark: Partitions and Transformations**
1. What is a partition in Spark? Why are partitions important for distributed computing?
1. Explain the difference between transformations and actions in Spark. Give examples of each.
1. What is "lazy evaluation" in the context of Spark transformations? How does it affect performance?
1. You have a large DataFrame and want to optimize its performance. How can you control the number of partitions to achieve better parallelism? Explain the trade-offs.
