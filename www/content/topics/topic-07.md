This session covers the fundamental aspects of graph analytics and its application in various domains. We discuss the introduction to graph analytics, highlighting real-world use cases where graph analysis provides valuable insights.

We explore Spark's graph capabilities, which enable efficient processing and manipulation of large-scale graphs. This includes an overview of the GraphFrames library, a high-level abstraction for graph data that simplifies operations such as query execution and data transformation.

In this session, we create and explore sample graphs using real-world examples, demonstrating how to model complex relationships between entities. For instance, we examine a scenario where trips are represented as edges between neighborhoods, illustrating the concept of graph representation.

We delve into various graph algorithms available in Spark, including PageRank, shortest paths, connected components, and community detection. These algorithms enable analysis of network properties, providing insights into structure and behavior within complex systems.

Furthermore, we discuss integrating graph features into machine learning pipelines, focusing on feature extraction from graphs. This involves leveraging the rich information contained within graph structures to enhance model performance and accuracy.

If time allows, we provide a brief overview of Spark's streaming capabilities, specifically Structured Streaming, which enables real-time processing and analytics. We explore how this can be used in conjunction with graph algorithms to analyze dynamic networks and adapt to changing conditions.
