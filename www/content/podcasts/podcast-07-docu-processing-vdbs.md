Vector databases have emerged as a crucial tool for enhancing the efficiency and capabilities of large language models (LLMs), offering improved information retrieval, knowledge management, and computational efficiency. By storing and managing high-dimensional data representations, these databases enable LLMs to access vast amounts of information quickly and accurately, leading to more contextually relevant and up-to-date responses in various applications.
