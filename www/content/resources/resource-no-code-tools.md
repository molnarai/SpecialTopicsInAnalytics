The landscape of AI tools is changig quickly; new tools emerge, others may become outdated.
The likelyhood that some of the initially free tools may require payments at some time is high.
Below are six no-code tools for building Agentic AI solutions that you can try now: 

1. **Amazon PartyRock** <https://partyrock.aws/><br />
Amazon PartyRock leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable users to create generative AI applications through a simple drag-and-drop interface. It supports chaining prompts, experimenting with foundational models, and building shareable apps, such as chatbots or productivity tools, without requiring an AWS account.

2. **Dify** <https://dify.ai/><br />
Dify is an open-source platform designed for rapid prototyping of AI agents. Its user-friendly features include a visual prompt editor, one-click model fine-tuning, and seamless integration with tools like Zapier. It also supports Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware responses, making it ideal for creating production-grade generative AI applications.

 3. **AutoGen** <https://github.com/microsoft/autogen><br />
Developed by Microsoft, AutoGen specializes in multi-agent systems with advanced customization options. It enables the creation of autonomous workflows and supports deep integrations with natural language processing (NLP) models, making it suitable for complex Agentic AI solutions.

4. **Bubble**
<https://bubble.io/><br />
Bubble allows users to build intelligent web applications visually. It offers drag-and-drop design capabilities and integrates AI features like chatbots or predictive analytics, making it a go-to choice for startups aiming to incorporate AI into their products.

5. **Glide**
<https://www.glideapps.com/><br />
Glide focuses on creating mobile-friendly apps powered by Google Sheets as a backend. It provides pre-built templates and an intuitive interface for designing lightweight, mobile-first AI applications quickly.

6. **n8n**
<https://n8n.io/ai/></br />
n8n is an open-source workflow automation tool that excels in connecting services and building custom automations. With over 400 pre-built integrations and native support for AI frameworks like LangChain, n8n enables users to create autonomous agents that interact with APIs or perform complex tasks like email automation or data extraction. Its flexibility allows both no-code users and developers to build sophisticated workflows through a visual interface or custom scripting.

These tools make it easier than ever to design Agentic AI systems tailored to specific needs, democratizing access to advanced technologies while fostering innovation across industries.
