 Alammar and Grootendorst's book provides a clear and accessible exploration of transformer architectures, fine-tuning techniques, and generative AI workflows, making it ideal for understanding the core principles of LLMs.
 Huang's guide, on the other hand, emphasizes actionable strategies for deploying AI systems in production, including prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation, and cost-effective optimization.
 
 Together, these resources provide a balanced perspective on both the conceptual underpinnings and the practical challenges of working with modern AI technologies.
