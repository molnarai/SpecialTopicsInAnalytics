description: Overview of Prompt Engineering Techniques with Examples

Prompt engineering techniques are designed to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to handle complex tasks, improve accuracy, and deliver nuanced outputs. 

Consider these for effective us of GenAI:
- **Combine Techniques**: Use multiple methods together, such as combining personas with CoT prompting for domain-specific reasoning.
- **Provide Clear Instructions**: Be explicit about desired outcomes, formats, and tones.
- **Iterate and Experiment**: Continuously refine prompts based on feedback from generated outputs.
